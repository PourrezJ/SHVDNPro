Script Hook V .NET Pro
======================

This is a fork of Crosire's [ScriptHookVDotNet](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet). The core has been rewritten to work with multiple real SHV script functions instead of only 1. The benefit of this is that you get a major performance boost due to the fact that we don't need to start our own threads and queue up natives on the main script thread, we can just call natives directly.

The fork was created for the [Grand Theft Multiplayer](https://gt-mp.net/) mod with the aim to boost performance, but later repurposed as an open source library.

## Requirements

* [C++ ScriptHook by Alexander Blade](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)

## Contributing

You'll need Visual Studio 2017 or higher to open the project file and the [Script Hook V SDK](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) extracted into "[/SDK](/SDK)".

Feel free to send a pull request. I'm not sure I will be able to contribute a lot more to this project, as I've stopped being active in the community.
